Hi everyone, My name is Hao Do (like "How do you do?") and I am a Software Engineering student. I used to be a member of a FIRST robotics team, the Talons (3588), and also a PM for a VEX robotic team, the Resistor Cats (19387A). I do play games (unfortunately) such as Valorant (somewhat competitive), Minecraft, and Overwatch, but I'm also down to play other games too. I am very excited to be welcomed to RIT, looking forward to what I can accomplish in the future, and ready to meet new people and listen to their journey.

Things to looked forward to:
- life advices on basic human needs
- Many, many, CO-OP and internship advices
- Knowing the areas outside the campus to explore
